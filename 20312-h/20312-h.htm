1</span>I.&nbsp; OUT OF THE DEEP OF SUFFERING AND SORROW.</h2>
<blockquote><p><!-- page 2--><a name="page2"></a><span 
class="pagenum">p. 2</span>Save me, O God, for the waters are 
come in even unto my soul: I am come into deep waters; so that 
the floods run over me.&mdash;Ps. lxix. 1, 2.</p>
<p>I am brought into so great trouble and misery: that I go 
mourning all the day long.&mdash;Ps. xxxviii. 6.</p>
<p>The sorrows of my heart are enlarged: Oh! bring Thou me out of
my distress.&mdash;Ps. xxv. 17.</p>
<p>The Lord hath heard the voice of my weeping: the Lord will 
receive my prayer.&mdash;Ps. vi. 8.</p>
<p>In the multitude of the sorrows which I had in my heart, Thy 
comforts have refreshed my soul.&mdash;Ps. xciv. 17.</p>
</blockquote>
<p><!-- page 3--><a name="page3"></a><span class="pagenum">p. 
3</span>Each heart knows its own bitterness; each soul has its 
own sorrow; each man&rsquo;s life has its dark days of storm and 
tempest, when all his joys seem blown away by some sudden blast 
of ill-fortune, and the desire of his eyes is taken from him, and
all his hopes and plans, all which he intended to do or to enjoy,
are hid with blinding mist, so that he cannot see his way before 
him, and knows not whither to go, or whither to flee for help; 
when faith in God seems broken up for the moment, when he feels 
<!-- page 4--><a name="page4"></a><span class="pagenum">p. 
4</span>no strength, no purpose, and knows not what to determine,
what to do, what to believe, what to care for; when the very 
earth seems reeling under his feet, and the fountains of the 
abyss are broken up.</p>
<p>When that day comes, let him think of God&rsquo;s covenant and
take heart.&nbsp; Is the sun&rsquo;s warmth perished out of the 
sky because the storm is cold with hail and bitter winds?&nbsp; 
Is God&rsquo;s love changed because we cannot feel it in our 
trouble?&nbsp; Is the sun&rsquo;s light perished out of the sky 
because the world is black with cloud and mist?&nbsp; Has God 
forgotten to give light to suffering souls, because we cannot see
our way for a few short days of perplexity?</p>
<p>No.&nbsp; God&rsquo;s message to every sad and desolate heart 
on earth, is that God is Light, and in Him is no darkness at all;
that God <!-- page 5--><a name="page5"></a><span 
class="pagenum">p. 5</span>is Love, and in Him there is no 
cruelty at all; that God is One, and in Him there is no change at
all.&nbsp; And therefore we can pray boldly to Him, and ask Him 
to deliver us in the time of our tribulation and misery; in the 
hour of death, whether of our own death or the death of those we 
love; in the day of judgment, whereof it is 
written&mdash;&ldquo;It is God who justifieth us; who is he that 
condemneth?&nbsp; It is Christ who died, yea, rather who is risen
again, who even now maketh intercession for us.&rdquo;&nbsp; To 
that boundless love of God, which He showed forth in the life of 
Christ Jesus; to that perfect and utter will to deliver us which 
God showed forth in the death of Christ Jesus, when the Father 
spared not His own Son, but gave Him freely for us; to that 
boundless love we may trust ourselves, <!-- page 6--><a 
name="page6"></a><span class="pagenum">p. 6</span>our fortunes, 
our families, our bodies, our souls, and the bodies and souls of 
those we love.</p>
<p style="text-align: right"><i>National Sermons</i>.</p>
<p>To all, sooner or later, Christ comes to baptise them with 
fire.&nbsp; But do not think that the baptism of fire comes once 
for all to a man, in some one terrible affliction, some one awful
conviction of his own sinfulness and nothingness.&nbsp; No; with 
many&mdash;and those perhaps the best people&mdash;it goes on 
month after month, year after year.&nbsp; By secret trials, 
chastenings, which none but they and God can understand, the Lord
is cleansing them from their secret faults, and making them to 
understand wisdom secretly; burning out of them the chaff of 
self-will, and self-conceit, and vanity, and leaving only the 
pure gold of <!-- page 7--><a name="page7"></a><span 
class="pagenum">p. 7</span>righteousness.&nbsp; How many sweet 
and holy souls, who look cheerful enough before the eyes of man, 
yet have their secret sorrows.&nbsp; They carry their cross 
unseen all day long, and lie down to sleep on it at night; and 
they will carry it perhaps for years and years, and to their 
graves, and to the throne of Christ before they lay it down; and 
none but they and Christ will ever know what it was; what was the
secret chastisement which God sent to make that soul better which
seemed to us already too good for earth.&nbsp; So does the Lord 
watch His people, and tries them with fire, as the refiner of 
silver sits by his furnaces watching the melted metal till he 
knows that it is purged from all its dross by seeing the image of
his own face reflected on it.</p>
<p style="text-align: right"><i>Town and Country Sermons</i>.</p>
<p><!-- page 8--><a name="page8"></a><span class="pagenum">p. 
8</span>By sufferings was Christ made perfect; and what was the 
best path for Jesus Christ is surely good enough for us, even 
though it be a rough and thorny one.&nbsp; Let us lie still 
beneath God&rsquo;s hand; for though His hand be heavy upon us, 
it is strong and safe beneath us too; and none can pluck us out 
of His hand, for in Him we live and move and have our 
being.&nbsp; He waits for us year after year, with patience which
cannot tire; therefore, let us wait awhile for Him.&nbsp; With 
Him is plenteous redemption, and therefore redemption enough for 
us and for those likewise whom we love.&nbsp; And though we go 
down into hell with David, with David we shall find God there 
(Ps. cxxxix. 8; Ps. xvi. 10), and find that He does not leave our
souls in hell, nor suffer His holy ones to see corruption.&nbsp; 
<!-- page 9--><a name="page9"></a><span class="pagenum">p. 
9</span>Yes, have faith in God.&nbsp; Nothing in thee which He 
has made shall see corruption; for it is a thought of 
God&rsquo;s, and no thought of His can perish.&nbsp; Nothing 
shall be purged out of thee, but thy disease; nothing shall be 
burnt out of thee but thy dross; and that in thee of which God 
said in the beginning, &ldquo;Let us make man in our own 
image,&rdquo; shall be saved and live to all eternity.&nbsp; Yes,
have faith in God, and cry to Him out of the deep, &ldquo;Though 
Thou slay me, yet will I love Thee, for Thou lovedst me in Jesus 
Christ before the foundation of the world.&rdquo;</p>
<p style="text-align: right"><i>Sermons</i>&mdash;<i>Good News of
God</i>.</p>
<p>Oh, sad hearts and suffering!&nbsp; Anxious and weary 
ones!&nbsp; Look to the cross of Christ.&nbsp; There hung your 
King!&nbsp; The King of sorrowing souls, and more, the <!-- page 
10--><a name="page10"></a><span class="pagenum">p. 10</span>King 
of Sorrows.&nbsp; Ay, pain and grief, tyranny and desertion, 
death and hell&mdash;He has faced them one and all, and tried 
their strength, and taught them His, and conquered them right 
royally.&nbsp; And since He hung upon that torturing cross, 
sorrow is divine, godlike, as joy itself.&nbsp; All that 
man&rsquo;s fallen nature dreads and despises, God honoured on 
the cross, and took unto Himself, and blest and consecrated for 
ever.&nbsp; And now blessed are the poor, if they are poor in 
heart as well as purse; for Jesus was poor, and theirs is the 
kingdom of heaven.&nbsp; Blessed are the hungry, if they hunger 
for righteousness as well as food; for Jesus hungered, and they 
shall be filled.&nbsp; Blessed are those who mourn, if they mourn
not only for their sorrows, but for their sins; for Jesus mourned
for our sins, <!-- page 11--><a name="page11"></a><span 
class="pagenum">p. 11</span>and on the cross He was made sin for 
us, who knew no sin; and they shall be comforted.&nbsp; Blessed 
are those who are ashamed of themselves, and hate themselves, and
humble themselves before God, for on the cross Jesus humbled 
Himself; and they shall be exalted.&nbsp; Blessed are the 
forsaken and despised; did not all men forsake Jesus in His hour 
of need?&nbsp; And why not thee, too, thou poor deserted 
one?&nbsp; Shall the disciple be above his Master?&nbsp; 
No.&nbsp; Every one that is perfect must be as his Master.</p>
<p style="text-align: right"><i>National Sermons</i>.</p>
<p>Never let us get into the common trick of calling unbelief 
Resignation; of asking, and then because we have not faith to 
believe, putting in a &ldquo;Thy will be done&rdquo; at the 
end.&nbsp; Let us make God&rsquo;s will our will, and so say, 
&ldquo;Thy will be done.&rdquo;&nbsp; <!-- page 12--><a 
name="page12"></a><span class="pagenum">p. 12</span>There is a 
false as well as a true and holy resignation.&nbsp; When the 
sorrow is come or coming, or necessary apparently for 
others&rsquo; good, let us say with our Master in the Agony, 
&ldquo;Not what we will, but what Thou wilt!&rdquo;&nbsp; But up 
to that point, let us pray boldly.</p>
<p style="text-align: right"><i>Letters and Memories of Charles 
Kingsley</i>.</p>
<p>Christianity heightens as well as deepens the human as well as
the divine affections.&nbsp; I am happy; for the less hope, the 
more faith.&nbsp; God knows what is best for us.&nbsp; I am sure 
we do not.&nbsp; Continual resignation, I begin to find, is the 
secret of continual strength.&nbsp; &ldquo;Daily dying,&rdquo; as
B&oelig;hmen interprets it, &ldquo;is the path of daily 
living.&rdquo;</p>
<p style="text-align: right"><i>Letters and Memories</i>.</p>
<p><!-- page 13--><a name="page13"></a><span class="pagenum">p. 
13</span>In all the trials of life, there is still some way of 
escape to be found if a man goes to the right place to look for 
it; and, if not of escape, still of compensation.&nbsp; I speak 
of that which I know.&nbsp; Of my own comfort I will not 
speak&mdash;of the path by which I attained it I will.&nbsp; It 
was simply by not struggling, doing my work vigorously where God 
had put me, and believing firmly that His promises had a real, 
not a mere metaphorical meaning, and that Psalms x., xxvii., 
xxxiv., xxxvii., cvii., cxii., cxxiii., cxxvi., cxlvi., are as 
practically true for us as they were for the Jews of old, and 
that it is the faithlessness of this day which prevents men from 
accepting God&rsquo;s promises in their literal sense with simple
childlike faith.</p>
<p style="text-align: right"><i>Letters and Memories</i>.</p>
<p><!-- page 14--><a name="page14"></a><span class="pagenum">p. 
14</span>Do not fear the clouds and storm and rain; look at the 
bow in the cloud, in the very rain itself.&nbsp; That is a sign 
that the sun, though you cannot see it, is shining 
still&mdash;that up above, beyond the cloud, is still sunlight 
and warmth and cloudless blue sky.&nbsp; Believe in God&rsquo;s 
covenant.&nbsp; Believe that the sun will conquer the clouds, 
warmth will conquer cold, calm will conquer storm, fair will 
conquer foul, light will conquer darkness, joy will conquer 
sorrow, life conquer death, love conquer destruction and the 
devouring floods; because God is light, God is love, God is life,
God is peace and joy eternal, God is without change, and labours 
to give life and joy and peace to man and beast and all created 
things.&nbsp; This was the meaning of the rainbow.&nbsp; It is a 
witness that <!-- page 15--><a name="page15"></a><span 
class="pagenum">p. 15</span>God, who made the world, is the 
friend and preserver of man; that His promises are like the 
everlasting sunshine which is above the clouds, without spot or 
fading, without variableness or shadow of turning.</p>
<p style="text-align: right"><i>National Sermons</i>.</p>
<p>If I did not believe in a special Providence, in a perpetual 
education of men by evil as well as good, by small things as well
as great&mdash;if I did not believe that&mdash;I could believe 
nothing.</p>
<p style="text-align: right"><i>Letters and Memories</i>.</p>
<p>Let us be content; we do not know what is good for us, and God
does.</p>
<p>It is true, and you will find it true (though God knows it is 
a difficult lesson enough to learn) that there should be no 
greater comfort to Christian people than to be made like Christ 
by suffering patiently <!-- page 16--><a name="page16"></a><span 
class="pagenum">p. 16</span>not only the hard work of every-day 
life, but sorrows, troubles, and sicknesses, and all our heavenly
Father&rsquo;s corrections, whensoever, by any manner of 
adversity, it shall please His gracious goodness to visit 
them.&nbsp; For Christ Himself went not up to joy, but first He 
suffered pain.&nbsp; He entered not into His glory before He was 
crucified.&nbsp; Therefore those words which we read in the 
Visitation of the Sick about this matter are not mere kind words,
meant to give comfort for the moment.&nbsp; They are truth and 
fact and sound philosophy.&nbsp; They are as true for the young 
lad in health and spirits as for the old folks crawling towards 
their graves.&nbsp; It is true that sickness and all sorts of 
troubles are sent to correct and amend in us whatsoever doth 
offend the eye of our heavenly Father.&nbsp; <!-- page 17--><a 
name="page17"></a><span class="pagenum">p. 17</span>It is true, 
and you will find it true, that whom the Lord loveth He 
chasteneth.</p>
<p style="text-align: right"><i>All Saints&rsquo; Day 
Sermons</i>.</p>
<p>&ldquo;That ye through patience and comfort of the Scriptures 
might have hope,&rdquo; says St. Paul; and, again, &ldquo;Let 
patience have her perfect work.&rdquo;&nbsp; But where are we to 
get patience?&nbsp; God knows it is hard in such a world as this 
for poor creatures to be always patient.&nbsp; But faith can 
breed patience, though patience cannot breed itself; and faith in
whom?&nbsp; Faith in our Father in Heaven, even in Almighty God 
Himself.&nbsp; He calls Himself the &ldquo;God of Patience and 
Consolation.&rdquo;&nbsp; Pray for His Holy Spirit, and He will 
make you patient; pray for His Holy Spirit, and He will console 
and comfort you.&nbsp; He has promised that Spirit of 
His&mdash;the Comforter&mdash;the <!-- page 18--><a 
name="page18"></a><span class="pagenum">p. 18</span>Spirit of 
Love, Trust, and Patience&mdash;to as many as ask Him.&nbsp; Ask 
Him at His Holy Table to make you patient; ask Him to change your
wills into the likeness of His will.&nbsp; Then will your eyes be
opened; then will you see in the Scriptures a sure promise of 
hope, and glory, and redemption for yourself and all the world; 
then you will see in the blessed Sacrament of the Lord&rsquo;s 
body and blood a sure sign and warrant, handed down from hand to 
hand, from age to age, from year to year, from father to son, 
that His promises shall be fulfilled&mdash;that patience shall 
have her perfect work&mdash;that hope shall become a 
reality&mdash;that not one of the Lord&rsquo;s words shall fail 
or pass away till all be fulfilled.</p>
<p style="text-align: right"><i>National Sermons</i>.</p>
<p><!-- page 19--><a name="page19"></a><span class="pagenum">p. 
19</span>God means some good to you by prostrating 
you&mdash;perhaps He means by giving you blessings almost without
your asking, to show you how little avails morbid sensitiveness 
or self-tormenting struggles.&nbsp; Synthetical minds are subject
to this self-torture.&nbsp; Such a period in your life is the 
time to become again a little child!&nbsp; I do not mean a 
re-regeneration, but a permitting of the mind to assume that tone
of calm wonder and infantile trust, which will allow all the 
innate principles within&mdash;all God-bestowed graces which have
been bruised and bowed by the tempest, to blossom gently upwards 
again, in &ldquo;the clear shining after rain&rdquo;&mdash;a 
breathing time in life&mdash;not too much retrospection or 
self-examination&mdash;keep that for the healthy and vigorous 
hours of the mind&mdash;but a silent basking in the <!-- page 
20--><a name="page20"></a><span class="pagenum">p. 20</span>light
of God&rsquo;s presence&mdash;a time for faith, more than for 
labour; for general and unexpressed, more than for particular or 
earnest prayer.</p>
<p style="text-align: right"><i>Letters and Memories</i>.</p>
<p>Sorrow, though dreary, is not barren.&nbsp; Nothing need be 
barren to those who view all things in their real light, as links
in the great chain of progression, both for themselves and for 
the universe.&nbsp; To us, all Time should seem so full of life; 
every moment the grave and the father of unnumbered events and 
designs in heaven and earth, revealing the mind of our God 
Himself&mdash;all things moving smoothly and surely, in spite of 
apparent checks and disappointments, towards the appointed 
End!</p>
<p style="text-align: right"><i>Letters and Memories</i>.</p>
<p><!-- page 21--><a name="page21"></a><span class="pagenum">p. 
21</span>In all the chances and changes of this mortal life, it 
is our one comfort to believe firmly and actively in the 
changeless kingdom, and in the changeless King.&nbsp; This alone 
will give us calm, patience, faith, and hope, though the heavens 
and the earth be shaken around us.&nbsp; For so only shall we see
that the kingdom, of which we are citizens, is a kingdom of 
light, and not of darkness; of truth, and not of falsehood; of 
freedom, and not of slavery; of bounty and mercy, and not of 
wrath and fear; that we live and move and have our being, not in 
a &ldquo;Deus quidam deceptor,&rdquo; who grudges His children 
wisdom, but in a Father of Light, from whom comes every good and 
perfect gift; who willeth that all men should be saved, and come 
to the knowledge of the truth.&nbsp; In His kingdom <!-- page 
22--><a name="page22"></a><span class="pagenum">p. 22</span>we 
are; and in the King whom He has set over it we can have most 
perfect trust.&nbsp; For us that King stooped from heaven to 
earth; for us He was born, for us He toiled, for us He suffered, 
for us He died, for us He arose again, for us He sits for ever at
God&rsquo;s right hand.&nbsp; And can we not trust Him?&nbsp; Let
Him do what He will.&nbsp; Let Him lead us whither He will.&nbsp;
Wheresoever He leads must be the way of truth and life.&nbsp; 
Whatsoever He does, must be in harmony with that infinite love 
which He displayed for us upon the Cross.&nbsp; Whatsoever He 
does must be in harmony with that eternal purpose by which He 
reveals to men God their Father.&nbsp; Therefore, though the 
heaven and the earth be shaken around us, we will trust in Him; 
for we know that He is the same yesterday, to-day, and for 
ever.</p>

where, and the how, are not only unimportant, but considering Who

all things.</p>

<p>Provided we attain at last to the truly heroic and divine 
life, which is the life of virtue, it will matter little to us by
what strange and weary ways, or through what painful and 
humiliating processes, we have arrived thither.&nbsp; If God has 
loved us, if God will receive us, then let us submit loyally and 
humbly to His law&mdash;&ldquo;Whom the Lord loveth He 
chasteneth, and scourgeth every son whom He receiveth.&rdquo;</p>

<p><!-- page 24--><a name="page24"></a><span class="pagenum">p. 
24</span>I believe that the wisest plan of bearing sorrow is 
sometimes not to try to bear it&mdash;as long as one is not 
crippled for one&rsquo;s every-day duties&mdash;but to give way 
to sorrow, utterly and freely.&nbsp; Perhaps sorrow is sent that 
we <i>may</i> give way to it, and, in drinking the cup to the 
dregs, find some medicine in it itself which we should not find 
if we began doctoring ourselves, or letting others doctor 
us.&nbsp; If we say simply, &ldquo;I am wretched, I ought to be 
wretched;&rdquo; then we shall perhaps hear a voice, &ldquo;Who 
made thee wretched but God?&nbsp; Then what can He mean but thy 
good?&rdquo;&nbsp; And if the heart answers impatiently, 
&ldquo;My good?&nbsp; I don&rsquo;t want it, I want my 
love!&rdquo; perhaps the voice may answer, &ldquo;Then thou shalt
have both in time.&rdquo;</p>

for it solves itself&mdash;so very soon at best&mdash;by 
death.&nbsp; Do what is right, the best way you can, and wait to 
the end to <i>know</i>. . . .</p>
<p>If, in spite of wars, and fevers, and accidents, and the 
strokes of chance, this world be green and fair, what must the 
coming world be like?&nbsp; Let us comfort ourselves as St. Paul 
did (in infinitely worse times), that the sufferings of this 
present time are not worthy to be compared with the glory that 
shall be revealed.&nbsp; It is not fair to quote one text about 
the creation groaning and travailing without the other, that it 
will not groan and travail long.&nbsp; Would the mother who has 
groaned and travailed and brought forth children&mdash;would she 
give up those children for the sake of not <!-- page 26--><a 
name="page26"></a><span class="pagenum">p. 26</span>having had 
that pain?&nbsp; Then believe that the day will come when the 
world, and every human being in it who has really groaned and 
travailed, would not give up its past pangs for the sake of its 
then present perfection, but will look back on this life, as the 
mother does on past pain, with glory and joy.</p>

<p>I write to you because every expression of human sympathy 
brings some little comfort, if it be only to remind such as you

not those who are gone, if they are gone to their Lord, be 
actually nearer us, not further from us, in the heavenly world, 
praying for us, and it may be, influencing and guiding us in a 
hundred ways, of which we in our prison-house of mortality cannot
dream?</p>
<p>Yes, do not be afraid to believe that he whom you have loved 
is still near you, and you near him, and both of you near God, 
who died on the Cross for you.&nbsp; That is all I can say.&nbsp;
But what comfort there is in it, if one can give up one&rsquo;s 
heart to believe it!</p>

<p>. . .&nbsp; All that I can say about the text, Matt. xxii. 30 
[of Marriage in the world to come], is that it has nought to do 
with me and my wife.&nbsp; I know that <!-- page 28--><a 
name="page28"></a><span class="pagenum">p. 28</span>if 
immortality is to include in my case identity of person, I shall 
feel for her for ever what I feel now.&nbsp; That feeling may be 
developed in ways which I do not expect; it may have provided for
it forms of expression very different from any which are among 
the holiest sacraments of life.&nbsp; Of that I take no 
care.&nbsp; The union I believe to be eternal as my own soul, and
I leave all in the hands of a good God.</p>
<p>Is not marriage the mere approximation to a unity that shall 
be perfect in heaven?&nbsp; And shall we not be reunited in 
heaven by that still deeper tie?&nbsp; Surely if on earth Christ 
the Lord has loved&mdash;some more than others;&mdash;why should 
not we do the same in heaven, and yet love all?</p>
<p>Do I thus seem to undervalue earthly bliss?&nbsp; No! I 
enhance it when I make it <!-- page 29--><a 
name="page29"></a><span class="pagenum">p. 29</span>the sacrament
of a higher union!&nbsp; Will not this thought give more 
exquisite delight; will it not tear off the thorn from every 
rose; and sweeten every nectar cup to perfect security of 
blessedness in this life, to feel that there is more in store for
us&mdash;that all expressions of love here, are but dim shadows 
of a union which will be perfect if we but work here, so as to 
work out our own salvation?</p>
<p style="text-align: right"><i>Letters and Memories</i>.</p>
<p>That is an awful feeling of having the roots which connect one
with the last generation seemingly torn up, and having to say, 
&ldquo;Now I am the root, I stand self-supported, with no other 
older stature to rest on.&rdquo; <a name="citation30"></a><a 
href="#footnote30" class="citation">[30]</a>&nbsp; But this one 
must believe that God is the God of Abraham, and that <!-- page 
30--><a name="page30"></a><span class="pagenum">p. 30</span>all 
live to Him, and that we are no more isolated and self-supported 
than when we were children on our mother&rsquo;s bosom.</p>
<p style="text-align: right"><i>Letters and Memories</i>.</p>
<p>Believe that those who are gone are nearer us than ever; and 
that if, as I surely believe, they do sorrow over the mishaps and
misdeeds of those whom they leave behind, they do not sorrow in 
vain.&nbsp; Their sympathy is a further education for them, and a
pledge, too, of help, and, I believe, of final deliverance for 
those on whom they look down in love.</p>

them unhappy here, because they could not perfectly do the will 
of God, are past and over for ever.&nbsp; But their works follow 
them.&nbsp; The good which they did on earth&mdash;that is not 
past and over.&nbsp; It cannot die.&nbsp; It lives and grows for 
ever, following on in their path long after they are dead, and 
bearing fruit unto everlasting life, not only in them, but in men

<p>&ldquo;A little while and ye shall not see me, and again a 
little while and ye shall see me, because I go to the 
Father,&rdquo; said our Lord when speaking of His own death to 
His sorrowing disciples.&nbsp; And if it be so with Christ, then 
is it so with those who are Christ&rsquo;s, with those whom <!-- 
page 32--><a name="page32"></a><span class="pagenum">p. 
32</span>we love.&nbsp; They are the partakers of His death, 
therefore they are the partakers of His resurrection.&nbsp; Let 
us believe that blessed news in all its fulness, and be at 
peace.&nbsp; A little while and we see them, and again a little 
while and we do not see them.&nbsp; But why?&nbsp; Because they 
are gone to the Father&mdash;to the source and fount of all life 
and power, all light and love, that they may gain life from His 
life, power from His power, light from His light, love from His 
love&mdash;and surely not for nought.&nbsp; Surely not for 
nought.&nbsp; For, if they were like Christ on earth, and did not
use their powers for themselves alone, if they are to be like 
Christ when they shall see Him as He is, the more surely will 
they not use their powers for themselves, but as Christ uses His,
for <!-- page 33--><a name="page33"></a><span class="pagenum">p. 
33</span>those they love?&nbsp; Surely, like Christ they may come
and go even now unseen.&nbsp; Like Christ they may breathe upon 
our restless hearts and say, &ldquo;Peace be unto 
you.&rdquo;&nbsp; And not in vain&mdash;for what they did for us 
when they were yet on earth they can do more fully now that they 
are in heaven.</p>
<p>They may seem to have left us, and we may weep and 
lament.&nbsp; But the day will come when the veil shall be taken 
from our eyes and we shall see them as they are&mdash;with Christ
and in Christ for ever&mdash;and remember no more our anguish, 
for joy that another human being has entered into that one true, 
real, and eternal world, wherein is neither disease, disorder, 
change, decay, nor death, for it is none other than the bosom of 
the Father.</p>

34</span>And what if earthly love seems so delicious that all 
change in it would seem a change for the worse, shall we 
repine?&nbsp; What does reason (and faith, which is reason 
exercised on the invisible) require of us, but to conclude that 
if there is change, there will be something better there?</p>
<p style="text-align: right"><i>Letters and Memories</i>.</p>
<p>What is the true everlasting life&mdash;the life of God and 
Christ&mdash;but a life of love, a life of perfect active, 
self-sacrificing goodness, which is the one only true life for 
all rational beings, whether on earth or in heaven&mdash;in 
heaven as well as on earth.&nbsp; Form your own notions as you 
will about angels and saints in heaven, (for every one must have 
some notions about them,) and try to picture to yourself what the
souls of those whom you have loved and lost are <!-- page 35--><a
name="page35"></a><span class="pagenum">p. 35</span> doing in the
other world; but bear this in mind, that if the saints in heaven 
live the everlasting life, they must be living a life of 
usefulness, of love, and of good works.</p>
<p>There are those who believe what we are too apt to forget, and
that is that the everlasting life cannot be a selfish and idle 
life, spent only in being happy oneself.&nbsp; They believe that 
the saints in heaven are not idle&mdash;that they are eternally 
helping mankind, doing all sorts of good offices for those souls 
who need them.&nbsp; I cannot see why they should not be 
right.&nbsp; For if the saints&rsquo; delight was to do good on 
earth, much more will it be to do good in heaven.&nbsp; If they 
helped poor sufferers, if they comforted the afflicted here on 
earth, much more will they be willing to help and comfort them, 
now that they are in the full power, the full freedom, <!-- page 
36--><a name="page36"></a><span class="pagenum">p. 36</span>the 
full love and zeal of the everlasting life.&nbsp; If their hearts
were warmed and softened by the fire of God&rsquo;s love here, 
how much more there!&nbsp; If they lived God&rsquo;s life of love
here, how much more there, before the throne of God and the face 
of Christ!</p>
<p>And if any one shall say that the souls of good men in heaven 
cannot help us who are here on earth, I answer&mdash;When did 
they ascend into heaven to find out that?&nbsp; If they had ever 
been there, let us be sure they would have had better news to 
bring home than this, that those whom we have honoured and loved 
on earth have lost the power which they used once to have of 
comforting us who are struggling below.</p>
<p>No, we will believe&mdash;what every one who loses a beloved 
friend comes sooner or later to believe&mdash;that those whom we 
have honoured <!-- page 37--><a name="page37"></a><span 
class="pagenum">p. 37</span>and loved, though taken from our 
eyes, are near to our spirits; that they still fight for us under
the banner of their Master, Christ, and still work for us by 
virtue of His life of love, which they live in Him and by Him for
ever.</p>
<p>Pray to them, indeed, we need not, as if they would help us 
out of any self-will of their own.&nbsp; They do God&rsquo;s 
will, and not their own; and go on God&rsquo;s errands, and not 
their own.&nbsp; If we pray to God our Father Himself, that is 
enough for us.&nbsp; And what shall we pray?&nbsp; &ldquo;Father,
Thy will be done on earth as it is in heaven.&rdquo;</p>
<p style="text-align: right"><i>Good News of God</i>, 
<i>Sermons</i>.</p>
<p>Is not that one thought that our beloved ones sleep in Christ 
Jesus enough?&nbsp; They sleep in Jesus, and therefore in 
infinite tenderness, sympathy, care, and love.&nbsp; They <!-- 
page 38--><a name="page38"></a><span class="pagenum">p. 
38</span>sleep in Jesus; and He is the Life, and therefore they 
sleep in Life.&nbsp; They sleep in Jesus; and He is the Light, 
and therefore they sleep in Light.&nbsp; They sleep in Jesus; and
He is Love, and therefore they sleep in Love.&nbsp; And what 
better?&nbsp; This is better&mdash;that they who sleep in Jesus 
must surely awaken.&nbsp; For, as it is written, His is a 
quickening, awakening, life-giving Spirit, and so to sleep in Him
is to sleep in the very fount and core of life and power.&nbsp; 
If from Jesus all our powers and talents come here on earth, 
surely He will give us more and nobler, when we sleep in Him, and
wake in Him to a risen and eternal life.&nbsp; And more, it is 
written that them that sleep in Jesus will He bring with 
Him.&nbsp; At the last day we shall see face to face those we 
loved&mdash;and before <!-- page 39--><a name="page39"></a><span 
class="pagenum">p. 39</span>that&mdash;oh! doubt it not.&nbsp; 
Oftentimes when Christ draws near our spirits He comes not alone,
but loving souls, souls whom we knew in the flesh on earth, bear 
up His train, and hover near our hearts and join their whispers 
to the voice and inspiration of Him who loved us, and who will 
guide us with counsel here, and after that receive us into glory,
where we shall meet those beloved ones&mdash;not as our 
forefathers dreamed, as meagre shadows flitting through dreary 
and formless chaos&mdash;but as we knew them once&mdash;the body 
of the flesh alone put off, but the real body, the spiritual body
to which flesh and blood was but a husk and shell, living and 
loving more fully, more utterly, than even before, because it is 
in Christ who is the fount of life, and freed in Him for ever 
from hell and death.</p>
<p><!-- page 40--><a name="page40"></a><span class="pagenum">p. 
40</span>And if you wish for a sign that this is so, come to holy
communion and take the bread and wine as a sign that your bodies 
and theirs, your souls and theirs, are fed from the same fount of

Christ Jesus, which He has given to be the life of the world.</p>

the question of all questions?&nbsp; And is not the answer the

God; the Spirit who proceedeth from the Father and the <!-- page

thee and to thy mourners.&nbsp; I speak peace to him that is near

not punishment, but the education of a Father.&nbsp; Blessed 
news, that our whole duty is the duty of a child&mdash;of the Son
who said in His agony, Father, not my will, but Thine be 
done.&nbsp; Blessed news, that our Comforter is the Spirit who 
comforted Christ the Son Himself; who proceeds both from the 
Father and the Son, and who will tell us that in Christ we are 
really and literally the children of God, who may cry to Him in

will some day bring us, into trouble, but to open our eyes <!--

has made is to obey Him?&nbsp; How can we prosper by doing 
anything else?&nbsp; It is ill fighting against God.&nbsp; But 
some one may say, &ldquo;I know I have sinned, and I do wish and 
long to obey God, but I am so weak, and my sins have so entangled
me, that I cannot obey God.&nbsp; I long to do so.&nbsp; I feel

unhappiness come from being proud and self-willed and determined 
to have my own way.&nbsp; But I <i>cannot</i> mend.&rdquo;</p>

miss brings a penalty, or rather is itself the penalty, is to me 
the best of news, and gives me hope for myself and for every

is a longing, and craving, and hunger at his heart after 
something better.&nbsp; Then he begins to remember his Heavenly 
Father&rsquo;s house.&nbsp; Old words, which he learnt in 
childhood; good old words out of his Catechism and Bible, start 
up strangely in his mind.&nbsp; He had forgotten them, laughed at
them perhaps in his <!-- page 52--><a name="page52"></a><span

up, he does not know where from, like beautiful ghosts gliding

old Sunday books were right after all.&nbsp; At least, I am

about whom I used to read in the old Sunday books is my Master

<p>The blessed St. Augustine found he could never conquer his own
sins by arguing with himself, or by any other means, till he got 
to know God, and to see that God was the Lord.&nbsp; And when his
spirit was utterly broken, when he saw himself to have been a 
fool and blind all along&mdash;then <!-- page 54--><a

which he learned at his mother&rsquo;s knee came up to his mind,

go wrong only to show him the folly of going wrong, caring for 
him, bearing with him, pleading with his conscience, alluring him
back to the only true happiness, as a loving father will a 
rebellious and self-willed child; and he became a changed 
man.&nbsp; To that blessed state may God of His great mercy bring
us in His own good time.&nbsp; And if He does bring us to it, it 
is little matter whether He brings us to it through joy or 
through sorrow, through honour or through shame, through the

to Christ, I do not believe I can one inch.&nbsp; I can see no 
hope but in prayer, in going to Him yourself, and saying: 
&ldquo;Lord, if Thou art there, if Thou art at all, if this be 
not all a lie, fulfil Thy reputed promises, and give me peace and
the sense of forgiveness, and the feeling that, bad as I may be,

<p>I have had to do that in past days; to challenge Him through 
outer darkness and the silence of night, till I almost expected 
that He would vindicate His own honour by appearing visibly, as 
He did to St. Paul and St. John; but He answered in <!-- page

parts.&nbsp; Thou wilt make me to understand wisdom 
secretly.&rdquo;&nbsp; What more rational belief?&nbsp; For 
surely if there be any God, and He made us at first, He who makes
can also mend His own work if it gets out of gear.&nbsp; What

education.&nbsp; Better, indeed, for us <!-- page 58--><a 
name="page58"></a><span class="pagenum">p. 58</span>perhaps that 
He should not cure us at once, lest we should fancy that sin was 
a light thing which we could throw off whenever we chose; and not
that it is an inward disease, corroding and corrupting, the wages
whereof are death.&nbsp; And so it is that because Christ loves 
us He hates our sins, and cannot abide or endure them, but will 
punish them, and is merciful and loving in punishing as long as a
tincture or remnant of sin is left in us.&nbsp; Therefore let us 
put ourselves into the hands of Christ, the Great Physician, and 
ask Him to heal our wounded souls, and purge our corrupted souls,
and leave to Him the choice of how He will do it.&nbsp; Let us be
content to be punished and chastised.&nbsp; Let Him deal with us,
if He sees fit, as He dealt <!-- page 59--><a

old, when He forgave the sin, and yet punished it by the death of

does&mdash;what He will do&mdash;make us good men.</p>

<p>My belief is that God will punish (has He not punished already
somewhat?) every wrong thing I ever did unless I 
repent&mdash;that is, change my behaviour therein; and that His 
lightest blow is hard enough to break bone and marrow.&nbsp; But 
as for saying of any human being whom I ever saw on earth that 
there is no hope for them; that if ever, under the bitter smart 
of just punishment, they opened their eyes to their folly and 
altered their mind, even then God would not forgive them; as for 
saying that, I will not for all the world <!-- page 60--><a 
name="page60"></a><span class="pagenum">p. 60</span>and the 
rulers thereof.&nbsp; I never saw a man in whom there was not 
some good, and I believe that God sees that good far more 
clearly, and loves it far more deeply, than I can, because He 
Himself put it there, and therefore it is reasonable to believe 
that He will educate and strengthen that good, and chastise the 
holder of it till he obeys it, and loves it, and gives himself up
to it; and that the said holder will find such chastisement 
terrible enough if he is unruly and stubborn I doubt not, and so 
much the better for him.&nbsp; Beyond this I cannot say.</p>

<p>If a man really believed himself to be a son, under a 
father&rsquo;s education, he would believe everything which 
happened to be a part of that education.&nbsp; And such a <!-- 
page 61--><a name="page61"></a><span class="pagenum">p.

before him as his lode-star&mdash;&ldquo;Our Father, hallowed be 
Thy name; Thy kingdom come; Thy will be done on earth as it is in
heaven;&rdquo; and asking even for his daily bread for that 
purpose and no other, would find selfishness and self-seeking die
out of him, and active benevolence grow up in him.&nbsp; He would
find past sorrows and falls turned unexpectedly to practical use 
for his own and other&rsquo;s good; and discover to his delight, 
that his Father had been educating him, while he fancied he was 
educating himself; and he would neither have leisure nor need to 
torment himself about the motives of his actions, but simply 
whatever his hand found to do, do it with all his might.</p>

Him, and were lightened.&nbsp; They that put their trust in Him

which grieved at the tomb of Lazarus, His friend; the heart which
wept over Jerusalem; the heart which said to the blessed 
Magdalene, the woman that was a sinner, &ldquo;Go in peace, thy 
sins are forgiven thee&rdquo;; the heart that yearns over every 
sinful and wandering soul all over the earth of God, crying to

and blood of Christ, which tells you that in spite of all your 
daily sins and failings, you can still look up to God as your 
Father; to the Lord Jesus as your life; to the Holy Spirit as

must be converted and turn back to God your Father not merely

take from me all I love best?&nbsp; Will He not hurl me into

Him!&nbsp; How then <!-- page 72--><a name="page72"></a><span

can I make Him change His mind?&nbsp; How can I soothe and 
appease Him?&nbsp; What shall I do to escape Him?&rdquo;</p>
<p>Did you ever have such thoughts?&nbsp; And did you ever find 
those thoughts, that slavish terror of God&rsquo;s wrath, that 
dread of hell make you better men?&nbsp; I never did.&nbsp; 
Unless you go beyond them&mdash;as far beyond them as heaven is 
beyond hell, as far above them as a free son is above a miserable
crouching slave, they will do you more harm than good.&nbsp; This
spirit of bondage, this slavish terror, instead of bringing us 
nearer to God, only drives us farther from Him.&nbsp; It does not
make us hate what is wrong, it only makes us dread the punishment
of it.</p>
<p>How then shall we escape the terror <!-- page 73--><a 
name="page73"></a><span class="pagenum">p. 73</span>and misery of
an evil conscience, and rise out of our sins?&nbsp; Believe the 
warrant of your baptism.&nbsp; Your baptism says to 
you&mdash;&ldquo;God is your Father, He does not hate you though 
you be the greatest sinner on earth.&nbsp; He loves you, for you 
are His child, and He willeth not the death of a sinner, but that
all should come and be saved.&nbsp; He hateth nothing that He has
made.&rdquo;&nbsp; This is the message of your baptism&mdash;that
you are God&rsquo;s child, and that God&rsquo;s will and wish is 
that you should grow up to become His son, to serve Him lovingly,
trustingly, manfully; and that He can and will give you the power
to do so; ay, He has given you the power already, <i>if</i> you 
will but claim and use it.&nbsp; But you must claim and use it, 
because you are meant not merely to be God&rsquo;s <!-- page

of the rod, but to be His willing, loving, loyal son.</p>
<p style="text-align: right"><i>National Sermons</i>.</p>
<p>God is not a tyrant who must be appeased with gifts, or a 
task-master who must be satisfied with the labour of his 
slaves.&nbsp; He is a Father, who loves His children, who gives 
and loveth to give, who gives to all freely, and upbraideth 
not.&nbsp; He truly willeth not the death of a sinner, but rather
that he should turn from his wickedness and live.&nbsp; His will 
is a good will, and howsoever much men&rsquo;s sin and folly may 
resist it, and seem for a time to mar it, yet He is too great and
good to owe any man, even the worst, the smallest spite or 
grudge.&nbsp; Patiently, nobly, magnanimously, God 
waits&mdash;waits for the man who is a <!-- page 75--><a 
name="page75"></a><span class="pagenum">p. 75</span>fool, to find
out his folly; waits for the heart which has tried to find 
pleasure in everything else, to find out that everything else 
disappoints, and to come back to Him, that fountain of all 
wholesome pleasure, that well-spring of all life fit for a man to
live.&nbsp; When the fool finds out his folly; when the wilful 
man gives up his wilfulness; when the rebel submits himself to 
law; when the son comes back to his father&rsquo;s 
house&mdash;there is no sternness, no upbraiding, no revenge; but
the everlasting and boundless love of God wells forth again as 
ever.&nbsp; The Creator has condescended to wait for His 
creature, because what He wanted was not His creature&rsquo;s 
fear, but His creature&rsquo;s love; not his lip-obedience, but 
his heart; because He wanted him not to come back as a trembling 
slave to his <!-- page 76--><a name="page76"></a><span 
class="pagenum">p. 76</span>master, but as a son who has found 
out at last what a father he has left him, when all beside has 
played him false.&nbsp; Let him come back thus, to find all is 
forgiven; and to hear the Father say, &ldquo;This my son was dead
and is alive again; he was lost and is found.&rdquo;</p>

<p>When the tempest comes; when affliction, fear, anxiety, shame 
come, then the Cross of Christ begins to mean something to 
us.&nbsp; For then in our misery and confusion we look up to 
heaven and ask, Is there any One in heaven who understands all 
this?&nbsp; Does God understand my trouble?&nbsp; Does God feel 
for my trouble?&nbsp; Does God care for my trouble?&nbsp; Does 
God know what trouble means?&nbsp; Or must I fight the battle of 
life alone, <!-- page 77--><a name="page77"></a><span 
class="pagenum">p. 77</span>without sympathy or help from God, 
who made me and has put me here?&nbsp; Then, does the Cross of 
Christ bring a message to our heart such as no other thing or 
being on earth can bring.&nbsp; For it says to us, God does 
understand thee utterly; for Christ understands thee.&nbsp; 
Christ feels for thee; Christ feels with thee; Christ has 
suffered for thee, and suffered with thee.&nbsp; Thou canst go 
through nothing which Christ has not gone through.&nbsp; He, the 
Son of God, endured poverty, fear, shame, agony, death for thee, 
that He might be touched with the feeling of thine infirmity and 
help thee to endure, and bring thee safe through all to victory 
and peace.</p>

<p>Though we, happily, no longer believe in the terror by night, 
which of old was <!-- page 78--><a name="page78"></a><span 
class="pagenum">p. 78</span>thought to come from witches, ghosts,
demons, yet there is a terror by night in which we must believe, 
for it comes to us from God, and should be listened to as the 
voice of God, even that terror about our own sinfulness, folly, 
weakness, which comes to us in dreams and sleepless nights.&nbsp;
We may learn from these night fancies and night thoughts; for 
they are often God&rsquo;s message to us, calling us to 
repentance and amendment of life.&nbsp; They are often 
God&rsquo;s Book of Judgment, wherein our sins are written, which
God is setting before us, and showing us the things we have 
done.&nbsp; God sends dreams to men which enable them to look 
back, and recollect things past, which they had forgot only too 
easily; and these humble and penitential dreams are God&rsquo;s 
warning that (as the <!-- page 79--><a name="page79"></a><span 
class="pagenum">p. 79</span>Article says) the infection of nature
doth remain even in those who are regenerate, and that nothing 
but the continual help of God&rsquo;s Spirit will keep us from 
falling back or falling away.</p>
<p style="text-align: right"><i>Discipline and other

<p>The religion of terror is the most superficial of all 
religions.&nbsp; God&rsquo;s arbitrary will and almighty power 
may seem dark by themselves though deep, as they do to the 
Calvinists, because they do not involve His moral 
character.&nbsp; Join them with the fact that He is a God of 
mercy as well as justice, remember that His essence is love, and 
the thunder cloud will blaze with dewy gold, full of soft rain 
and pure light.&nbsp; All the deep things of God are bright, for 
God is light.</p>

in them&mdash;As thy day so shall thy strength be?&nbsp; Have

they not been blessed lessons?&nbsp; Have we not had in all 
things with the temptation a way to escape?&nbsp; So out of evil 
God brings good; or rather out of necessity He brings 
strength.&nbsp; The highest spiritual training is contained in 
the most paltry physical accidents; and <!-- page 81--><a

educated.&nbsp; Therefore let us be only patient, patient; and 
let God our Father teach His own lesson, His own way.&nbsp; Let

misfortunes, and ask continually, What if this happened, or if 
that?&nbsp; How should I be able to get through such and such a

most awful, if most blessed of all questions is, But is there no

fault.&nbsp; Then I can plead with God, even though in wild words
like Job; and ask, What is the meaning of this sorrow?&nbsp; What
have I done?&nbsp; What should I do?&nbsp; I will say unto God, 
&ldquo;Do not condemn me; show me wherefore Thou contendest with 
me.&nbsp; Surely I would speak unto the Almighty; I desire to 
reason with God.&rdquo;&nbsp; Oh, my friends, a man, I believe, 
can gain courage and wisdom to say that only by the inspiration 
of the Spirit of God.&nbsp; But when once he has said that from 
his heart, he begins to be justified by faith; for he has had 
faith in God.&nbsp; He has trusted God&mdash;and more&mdash;he 
has justified God.&nbsp; He has confessed that God is not a mere

a broken heart and a repentant spirit.&nbsp; Blessed is death,

own sorrows.&nbsp; Rejoice that you are made free of the holy 
brotherhood of mourners; rejoice that you are counted worthy of a
fellowship in the sufferings of the Son of God.&nbsp; Rejoice and
trust on, for after sorrow shall come joy.&nbsp; Trust on; for in
man&rsquo;s weakness God&rsquo;s strength shall be made 
perfect.&nbsp; Trust on; for death is the gate of life.&nbsp; 
Endure on to the end, and possess your souls in patience for a 
little while, and that, perhaps, a very little while.&nbsp; Death
comes swiftly, and more swiftly still perhaps, the day of the 
Lord.&nbsp; The deeper the sorrow, the nearer the 
salvation:&mdash;</p>

down into the bottomless pit, and <!-- page 113--><a

of the utter darkness have asked the question of all 
questions&mdash;&ldquo;Is there a God? and if there be, what is 
He doing with me?&rdquo;&nbsp; What refuge then&mdash;when a man 
feels himself powerless in the gripe of some unseen and

His mind a spiritual coherence, an organic unity and purpose,

because He is making short work with our spirits; and because the

for us.&nbsp; He went down into hell for us, and conquered hell 
and death, and the darkness of the unknown world, and rose again 
glorious from them, that He might teach us not to fear death and 
hell; that He might know how to comfort us in the hour of death, 
and in the day of judgment, <!-- page 126--><a

<p>Whatever may be the mysteries of life and death, there is one 
mystery which the Cross of Christ reveals to us, and that is the 
infinite and absolute goodness of God.&nbsp; Let all the rest 
remain a mystery so long as the mystery of the Cross of Christ 
gives us faith for all the rest.&nbsp; Faith, I say.&nbsp; The 
mystery of evil, of terror, of death, the gospel does not pretend
to solve, but it tells us that the mystery is proved to be 
soluble; for God Himself has taken upon Himself the task of 
solving it; and Christ has proved <!-- page 127--><a 
name="page127"></a><span class="pagenum">p. 127</span>by His own 
act, that if there be evil in the world, it is none of His, for 
He hates it, fights against it, and He fought against it to the 
death.&nbsp; The Cross says, Have faith in God.&nbsp; Ask no more
of Him, &ldquo;Why hast thou made me thus?&rdquo;&nbsp; Ask no 
more, &ldquo;Why do the wicked prosper on the earth?&rdquo;&nbsp;
Ask no more, &ldquo;Whence pain and death, war and famine, 
earthquake and tempest, and all the ills to which flesh is 
heir?&rdquo;&nbsp; All fruitless questioning, all peevish 
repinings are precluded henceforth by the death and passion of 
Christ.</p>
<p>Dost thou suffer?&nbsp; Thou canst not suffer more than the 
Son of God.&nbsp; Dost thou sympathise with thy 
fellow-sufferers?&nbsp; Thou canst not sympathise more than the 
Son of God.&nbsp; Dost thou long to right them, to <!-- page 
128--><a name="page128"></a><span class="pagenum">p. 
128</span>deliver them, even at the price of thine own 
blood?&nbsp; Thou canst not long more ardently than the Son of 
God, who carried His longing into act, and died for them and 
thee.&nbsp; What if the end be not yet?&nbsp; What if evil still 
endure?&nbsp; What if the medicine have not yet conquered the 
disease?&nbsp; Have patience, have faith, have hope, as thou 
standest at the foot of Christ&rsquo;s Cross, and holdest fast to
it, as the Anchor of thy soul and reason, as well as of thy 
heart.&nbsp; For however ill the world may go, or seem to go, the
Cross is the everlasting token that God so loved the world, that 
He spared not His only begotten Son, but freely gave Him for 
it.&nbsp; Whatsoever else is doubtful this at least is sure, that
God must conquer, because God is good; that Evil must <!-- page

<p>How shall the bottomless pit, if we fall into it, be a pathway
to the everlasting rock?&nbsp; David tells us, &ldquo;Out of the 
deep have I cried unto Thee, O God.&rdquo;&nbsp; He cried to 
God&mdash;not to himself, his own learning, prudence, 
talents&mdash;to pull him out of that pit.&nbsp; Not to 
doctrines, books, church-goings&mdash;not to the dearest earthly 
friend&mdash;not to his own experiences, faith&rsquo;s 
assurances, frames and feelings.&nbsp; The matter was too 
terrible to be plastered over in that way, or in any way.&nbsp; 
He was face to face with God alone, and in utter weakness, in 
utter nakedness of soul, <i>he cried to God Himself</i>.&nbsp; 
There was the lesson.&nbsp; God took away from him all <!-- page

God.</p>
<p>And it shall be with every soul of man who, being in the deep,
cries out of the deep to God, as it was with Moses when he went 
up alone into the Mount of God, and fasted forty days and forty 
nights amid the earthquake and the thunderstorm, and the rocks 
which melted before the Lord.&nbsp; And behold, when it was past,
he talked face to face with God, as a man talketh with his

hope for all; to be fair and patient and tender with everyone we

the next world be like?&nbsp; What is heaven like?&nbsp; Shall I 
be able to enjoy it?&nbsp; Shall I be a man there, or only a 
ghost, a spirit without a body?</p>
<p>To this St. Paul answers, that Christ, the Son of God, after 
that He was manifested in the flesh, was received up into 
glory.&nbsp; He does not tell us what heaven is like, for though 
he had been caught up into the third heaven, yet what he saw 
there was unspeakable.&nbsp; Neither does he <!-- page 140--><a 
name="page140"></a><span class="pagenum">p. 140</span>tell us 
what the next life will be like; all he says is, the Man Christ 
Jesus, who walked this earth like other men, was received up into
glory, and He did not leave His man&rsquo;s mind, His man&rsquo;s
heart, even His man&rsquo;s body behind Him.&nbsp; He carried up 
into heaven with Him His whole manhood, spirit, soul, and body, 
even to the print of the nails in His hands, and in His most holy
feet, and the wound of the spear in His most holy side.&nbsp; 
That is enough for us; because the Man Christ Jesus is in heaven,
we, as men, may ascend to heaven.&nbsp; Where He is we shall 
be.&nbsp; And what He is, in as far as He is Man, we shall 
be.&nbsp; And this we do know, that we shall be like Him, for we

going to heaven.&nbsp; But when they think of actually

<p>When you are in terror, trouble, and affliction, ay! and in 
the black jaws of death, and know not where to turn, that blessed

shield and a strength to you which no other thought can 
give.&nbsp; <!-- page 142--><a name="page142"></a><span

from sad, dark thoughts, from fear and despair, or from stupid 
carelessness, and the death <!-- page 143--><a

doing.&rdquo;&nbsp; So says the Burial Psalm.&nbsp; So let us say
likewise.&nbsp; &ldquo;I became dumb:&rdquo; not with rage, not 
with despair; but because it was Thy doing, and therefore it was 
done well.&nbsp; It was the deed, not of chance, nor of 
necessity.&nbsp; Not so.&nbsp; For it was the deed of the Father,
without whom a sparrow falls not to the ground; of the Son who 
died upon the Cross in the utterness of His desire to save; of 
the Holy Ghost, who is the Lord and Giver of Life to all created 
things.&nbsp; It was the deed of One who delights in Life and not
in Death; in bliss and not in woe; in light and not in darkness; 
in order and not in anarchy; in good and not in evil.&nbsp; It 
had a final cause, a meaning, a purpose; and that purpose is very
good.&nbsp; What it is, we know not; and we need <!-- page

earth.&nbsp; But no sooner does the sun of spring shine upon 
their graves, than they rise into sudden life and beauty, as it 
pleases God, and every seed takes its own peculiar body.&nbsp; 
Sown in corruption, they are raised in <!-- page 157--><a 
name="page157"></a><span class="pagenum">p. 
157</span>incorruption; sown in weakness, they are raised in 
power; sown in dishonour, they are raised in glory; delicate, 
beautiful in colour, perfuming the air with fragrance; types of 
immortality, fit for the crowns of angels.</p>
<p>Consider the lilies of the field, how they grow.&nbsp; For 
even so is the Resurrection of the dead.&nbsp; Yes, not without a
divine providence&mdash;yea, a divine inspiration&mdash;has the 
blessed Eastertide been fixed, by the Church of all ages, as the 
season when the earth shakes off her winter&rsquo;s sleep; when 
the birds come back, and the flowers begin to bloom, when every 
seed which falls into the ground and dies, and rises again with a
new body, is a witness to us of the Resurrection of Christ; and a
witness, too, that we shall rise again; that in us, as <!-- page 
158--><a name="page158"></a><span class="pagenum">p. 158</span>in
it, life shall conquer death; when every bird that comes back to 
sing and build among us, every flower that blows, is a witness to
us of the Resurrection of the Lord and of our Resurrection. . . 
.&nbsp; They obey the call of the Lord, the Giver of Life, when 
they return to life, as a type and a token to us of Christ their 
Maker, who was dead and is alive again, who was lost in hell on 
Easter eve, and was found again in heaven for evermore.&nbsp; And
so the resurrection of the earth from her winter&rsquo;s sleep, 
commemorates to us, as each blessed Eastertide comes round, the 
Resurrection of our Lord Jesus Christ, and is a witness to us 
that some day life shall conquer death, light conquer darkness, 
righteousness conquer sin, joy conquer grief; when the whole 
creation, which groaneth and travaileth in <!-- page 159--><a 
name="page159"></a><span class="pagenum">p. 159</span>pain until 
now, shall have brought forth that of which it travaileth in 
labour&mdash;even the new heavens and the new earth, wherein 
shall be neither sighing nor sorrow, but God shall wipe away 
tears from all eyes.</p>

<p>Death is not death if it kills no part of us save that which 
hindered us from perfect life.&nbsp; Death is not death, if it 
raises us in a moment from darkness into light, from weakness 
into strength, from sinfulness into holiness.&nbsp; Death is not 
death, if it brings us nearer to Christ who is the fount of 
life.&nbsp; Death is not death, if it perfects our faith by 
sight, and lets us behold Him in whom we have believed.&nbsp; 
Death is not death, if it gives us to those whom we have loved 
and lost, for whom we have lived, for whom <!-- page 160--><a 
name="page160"></a><span class="pagenum">p. 160</span>we long to 
live again.&nbsp; Death is not death, if it joins the child to 
the mother who was gone before.&nbsp; Death is not death, if it 
takes away from that mother for ever all a mother&rsquo;s 
anxieties, a mother&rsquo;s fears, and lets her see, in the 
gracious countenance of her Saviour, a sure and certain pledge 
that those whom she has left behind are safe, safe with Christ 
and in Christ, through all the chances and dangers of this mortal
life.&nbsp; Death is not death, if it rids us of doubt and fear, 
of chance and change, of space and time, and all which space and 
time bring forth, and then destroy.&nbsp; Death is not death; for
Christ has conquered death for Himself, and for those who trust 
in Him.</p>

<blockquote><p>Hear my prayer, O God; and hide not Thyself from 
my petition.&nbsp; Take heed unto me and hear me; how I mourn in 
my prayer and am vexed.&mdash;Psalm iv. 1, 2.</p>
<p>In my trouble I will call upon the Lord, and complain unto my 
God; so shall He hear my voice out of His holy temple, and my 
complaint shall come before Him; it shall enter even into His 
ears.&mdash;Ps. xviii. 5, 6.</p>
<p>The Lord is nigh unto them that call upon Him; He also will 
hear their cry, and will help them.&mdash;Psalm cxlv. 18, 19.</p>

165</span>The older I grow, and the more I see of the chances and
changes of this mortal life, and of the needs and longings of the
human heart, the more important seems this question: Is there 
anywhere in the universe any being who can hear our 
prayers?&nbsp; Is prayer a superfluous folly, or the highest 
prudence?&nbsp; I say: Is there a being who can ever hear our 
prayers?&nbsp; I do not say a being who will always answer them, 
and give us all we ask; but one who will at least hear, who will 
listen consider what is <!-- page 166--><a 
name="page166"></a><span class="pagenum">p. 166</span>fit to be 
granted or not, and grant or refuse accordingly?</p>
<p>Is that strange instinct of worship which rises in the heart 
of man as soon as he begins to think, to become a civilized being
and not a savage, to be disregarded as a childish dream when he 
rises to a higher civilization still?&nbsp; Is the experience of 
men, heathen as well as Christian, for all these ages to go for 
nought?&nbsp; Has every utterance that has ever gone up from 
suffering and doubting humanity gone up in vain?&nbsp; Have the 
prayers of saints, the hymns of psalmists, the agonies of 
martyrs, the aspirations of poets, the thoughts of sages, the 
cries of the oppressed, the pleadings of the mother for her 
child, the maiden praying in her chamber for her lover upon the 
distant battlefield, the soldier answering her prayer <!-- page 
167--><a name="page167"></a><span class="pagenum">p. 
167</span>from afar off with &ldquo;Keep quiet, I am in 
God&rsquo;s hands&rdquo;&mdash;those very utterances of humanity 
which seemed to us most noble, most pure, most beautiful, most 
divine&mdash;been all in vain?&nbsp; Mere impertinences, the 
babblings of fair dreams, poured forth into no where, to no 
thing, and in vain?&nbsp; Has every suffering, searching soul 
which ever gazed up into the darkness of the unknown, in hopes of
catching even a glimpse of a divine Eye, beholding all, and 
ordering all, and pitying all, gazed up in vain?&nbsp; Oh! my 
friends, those who believe, or fancy they believe, such things, 
and can preach such doctrines without pity and sorrow, know not 
of what they rob a mankind already but too miserable by its own 
folly and its own sin&mdash;a mankind which if it have not hope 
in God and in Christ, is truly, as <!-- page 168--><a 
name="page168"></a><span class="pagenum">p. 168</span>Homer said 
of old, more miserable than the beasts of the field.</p>
<p style="text-align: right"><i>Westminster Sermons</i>.</p>
<p>When the human heart asks, Have we not only a God in Heaven, 
but a Father in Heaven? that question can only be answered by our
Lord Jesus Christ.&nbsp; Truly He said, &ldquo;No one cometh unto
the Father but by Me.&nbsp; The only begotten Son, who is in the 
bosom of the Father, He hath revealed Him.&rdquo;&nbsp; And 
therefore we can find boundless comfort in the words, &ldquo;Such
as the Father is, such is the Son and such the Holy 
Ghost.&rdquo;&nbsp; For now we know that there is <span 
class="smcap">A Man</span> in the midst of the throne who is the 
brightness of God&rsquo;s glory and the express image of His 
person&mdash;a high priest who can be touched by the feeling of 
our infirmities, seeing He was tempted in <!-- page 169--><a 
name="page169"></a><span class="pagenum">p. 169</span>all things 
like as we are.&nbsp; To Him we can cry with human passion and in
human words, because we know that His human heart will respond to
our human hearts, and that His human heart again will respond to 
His Divine Spirit, and that His Divine Spirit is the same as the 
Divine Spirit of His Father, for their wills and minds are One, 
and their will and their mind is boundless love to sinful 
men.</p>
<p>Yes, we can look up in our extreme need by faith into the 
sacred face of Christ, and by faith take refuge within His sacred
heart, saying, If it be good for me, He will give what I ask; and
if He gives it not, it is because that too is good for me, and 
for others beside me.&nbsp; In all the chances and changes of 
this mortal life we can say to Him, as He said in that supreme 
hour&mdash;<!-- page 170--><a name="page170"></a><span 
class="pagenum">p. 170</span>&ldquo;If it be possible let this 
cup pass from Me, nevertheless not My will but Thine be 
done;&rdquo; sure that He will present that prayer to His Father 
and to our Father, and to His God and our God; and that 
whatsoever be the answer vouchsafed by Him whose ways are not as 
our ways, nor His thoughts as our thoughts, the prayer will not 
have gone up to Christ in vain.</p>
<p style="text-align: right"><i>Westminster Sermons</i>.</p>
<p>I have been praying long and earnestly, and have no fears 
now.&nbsp; &ldquo;Whatsoever ye shall ask in my name, 
<i>believing</i>, ye shall receive.&rdquo;&nbsp; &ldquo;Lord, I 
believe, help Thou my unbelief.&rdquo;&nbsp; Those two texts were
my stronghold when the night of misery was most utterly dark, and
in the strength of them we shall prevail.&nbsp; Fret not <!--

do.</p>
<p style="text-align: right"><i>Letters and Memories</i>.</p>
<p>The longer I live the more I see that the Lord&rsquo;s Prayer 
is the pattern of all prayers; and whether it be consistent with 
that to ask that God should alter the course of the universe in 
the same breath that we say, &ldquo;Thy will be done on 
earth&rdquo;&mdash;judge you.&nbsp; I do not object to praying 
for special things.&nbsp; God forbid!&nbsp; I do it myself.&nbsp;
I cannot help doing it any more than a child in the dark can help
calling for its mother.&nbsp; Only it seems to me, that when we 
pray, &ldquo;Grant this day that we run into no kind of 
danger,&rdquo; we ought to lay our stress on the 
&ldquo;run,&rdquo; rather than on the &ldquo;danger&rdquo;; and 
ask God not to take away the danger by altering the course <!-- 
page 172--><a name="page172"></a><span class="pagenum">p. 
172</span>of nature, but to give us light and guidance whereby to
avoid it.</p>
<p style="text-align: right"><i>Letters and Memories</i>.</p>
<p>Pray night and day very quietly, like a little, weary child, 
for everything you want, in body as well as in soul&mdash;the 
least thing as well as the greatest&mdash;nothing is too much to 
ask God for&mdash;nothing too great for Him to grant&mdash;and 
try to thank Him for everything.&nbsp; Glory be to thee, O 
God!</p>
<p style="text-align: right"><i>Letters and Memories</i>.</p>
<p>When you are in the deep&mdash;whatever that depth 
be&mdash;cry to God: to God Himself, and none but God.&nbsp; If 
you can go to the pure fountain-head, why drink of the stream, 
which must have gathered something of defilement as it 
flows?&nbsp; If you can go to God Himself, why go to any of <!-- 
page 173--><a name="page173"></a><span class="pagenum">p. 
173</span>God&rsquo;s creatures, however holy, pure, and 
loving?&nbsp; Go to God, who is light of light, life of 
life.&nbsp; From Him all goodness flows.</p>
<p>Go then to Him Himself.&nbsp; Out of the deep, however deep, 
cry unto God, unto God Himself.&nbsp; If David the Jew of old 
could do so, much more we who are baptized into Christ; much more
can we who have access by one Spirit unto the Father; much more 
can we who, if we know who we are and where we are, should come 
boldly to the Throne of Grace, to find mercy and grace to help us
in the time of need.&nbsp; Hath He promised, and shall He not do 
it?&nbsp; To every one of you&mdash;however weak, however 
ignorant, aye, however sinful, if you desire to be delivered from
those sins&mdash;this grace is given; liberty to cry out of the 
depth to <!-- page 174--><a name="page174"></a><span 
class="pagenum">p. 174</span>God Himself, who made sun and stars,
all heaven and earth; liberty to stand face to face with the 
Father of the spirits of all flesh, and cling to the One Being 
who can never fail nor change, even to the One immortal, eternal 
God.</p>
<p style="text-align: right"><i>Westminster Sermons</i>.</p>
<p>The seed which we sow&mdash;the seed of repentance, the seed 
of humility, the seed of sorrowful prayers for help&mdash;shall 
take root and grow and bring forth fruit, we know not how, in the
good time of God who cannot change.&nbsp; We may be sad&mdash;we 
may be weary; our eyes may wait and watch for the Lord more than 
they who watch for the morning; but it must be as those who watch
for the morning, for the morning which must and will come; for 
the sun will surely rise, and the day will surely <!-- page

unto Him.</p>

stupid, and ill expressed&mdash;of him it is written: &ldquo;The

<p>O Lamb eternal, beyond all place and time!&nbsp; O Lamb of 
God, slain eternally before the foundation of the world!&nbsp; O 
Lamb that liest slain eternally in the midst of the throne of 
God!&nbsp; Let the blood of life, which flows from Thee, procure 
me pardon for the past; let the water of life, which flows from 
Thee, give me strength for the future.&nbsp; I come to cast away 
my own life, my life of self and selfishness, which is corrupt 
according to the deceitful lusts, that I may live it no more, and
to receive Thy life, which is created after the likeness of <!--

lightest every man that comes into the world, take away from me

Thy light, that I may see all things in light.&nbsp; Fill me with

salvation in the life to come.</p>

<p>O God, quench in us all which is selfish, idle, mean, and 
quicken to life in us all which is God-like and for God, that so

not from selfish ambition, not from selfish pride, not from 
selfish ease, but from getting rid of selfishness <!-- page

each of us has been called by his Father in Heaven.</p>

ignorant, unsuccessful; full of faults and failings, which make 
me ashamed of myself every day of my life.&nbsp; I have gone 
astray, like a sheep that is lost.&nbsp; But seek Thy servant, O 
Lord, for I do not forget Thy commandments.&nbsp; I am trying to 
learn my duty.&nbsp; I am trying to do my duty.&nbsp; I have 
stuck unto Thy testimonies.&nbsp; O Lord, have mercy and confound
me not.&nbsp; Man may confound me.&nbsp; But do not Thou of Thy 
mercy and pity, O Lord.&nbsp; Let me not find when I die, or 
before I die, that all my labour has been in vain; that I am not 
wiser, not more useful after all.&nbsp; Let not <!-- page

do my duty, my life has been a failure and I a fool.&nbsp; Let me
not wake in the next life, to be utterly confounded: to find that
I was all wrong, and have nothing left but disappointment and 
confusion of face.&nbsp; O Lord, who didst endure all shame for 
me, save me from that most utter shame.&nbsp; Thou art good and 
just.&nbsp; Thou wilt not leave my soul in hell.&nbsp; O God, in 
Thee have I trusted; let me never be confounded.</p>

<h3>FOR PEACE OF MIND.</h3>
<p>O Father, grant me Thy peace.&nbsp; I have not a peaceful 
spirit in me; and I know that I shall never get it by thinking, 
<!-- page 184--><a name="page184"></a><span class="pagenum">p.

and peace lies far away beyond it, in the very essence of Thine 
undivided, unmoved, absolute, Eternal Godhead, which no change 
nor decay of this created world, nor sin or folly of men or 
devils, can ever alter; but which abideth for ever what it is, in
perfect rest, and perfect power, and perfect love.&nbsp; Soothe 
this restless, greedy, fretful soul of mine, as a mother soothes 
a sick and feverish child.&nbsp; How Thou wilt do it I do not 
know.&nbsp; It passes all understanding.&nbsp; But though the 
sick child cannot reach the mother, the mother is at hand and can
reach it.&nbsp; And Thou art more than a mother: Thou art the 
Everlasting Father.&nbsp; Though the eagle by flying cannot reach
the sun, yet the sun is at hand, and can reach all the <!-- page

things.&nbsp; Thou art more than the sun; Thou art the Light and 
Life of all things.&nbsp; Pour Thy Light and Thy Life over me, 
that I may see as Thou seest, and live as Thou livest, and be at 
peace with myself and all the world, as Thou art at peace with 
Thyself and all the world.&nbsp; Pour Thy love over me, that I 
may love as Thou lovest.&nbsp; Again, I say, I know not how, for 
it passes all understanding; but I hope that Thou wilt do it for 
me, I trust that Thou wilt do it for me, for I believe that Thou 
art Love, and that Thy mercy is over all Thy works.&nbsp; I 
believe that Thou so lovest the world that Thou hast sent Thy Son
to save the world and me.&nbsp; I know not how, for that too 
passes understanding; but I believe that Thou wilt do it, for I 
believe that <!-- page 186--><a name="page186"></a><span

over all Thy works, even over me.&nbsp; I believe that Thy will

am, and goodwill to all men, even to me, the chief of 
sinners.</p>

<h3>PRAYER BEFORE HOLY COMMUNION.</h3>
<p>O blessed Jesus!&nbsp; Saviour, who agonized for us!&nbsp; God
Almighty, who didst make Thyself weak for the love of us!&nbsp; 
Oh, write that love upon our hearts so deeply that neither 
pleasure nor sorrow, life nor death may wipe it away!&nbsp; Thou 
hast sacrificed Thyself for us; oh, give us hearts to sacrifice 
ourselves for Thee!&nbsp; Thou art the Vine, we are the 
branches.&nbsp; Let Thy priceless blood, shed for us on the 
cross, flow like life-giving sap through all our <!-- page

that we may be sacrifices fit for Thee.&nbsp; Stir us up to offer
to Thee, O Lord, our bodies, our souls, our spirits; and in all 
we love and all we learn, in all we plan and all we do, to offer 
ourselves, our labours, our pleasures, our sorrows, to Thee; to 
work for Thy kingdom, to live as those who are not their own, but
bought with Thy blood, fed with Thy body; and enable us now, in 
Thy most Holy Sacrament, to offer to Thee our repentance, our 
prayers, our praises, living, reasonable, and spiritual 
sacrifices&mdash;Thine from our birth-hour&mdash;Thine now, and 
Thine for ever!</p>

myself; but Thou lovest me.&nbsp; I do not understand myself; but
Thou dost, and Thou wilt be merciful to the work of Thine own 
hands.&nbsp; I cannot guide and help myself, but Thou canst help 
me, and Thou wilt too, because Thou art my Father, and nothing 
can part me from Thy love, or from the love of Thy Son, my 
King.&nbsp; I come and claim my share in Thee, just because I 
have nothing, and can bring Thee nothing, but lie at Thy gate as 
a beggar full of sores, desiring to be fed with the crumbs from 
Thy table.&nbsp; And if I would help the wretched, how much more 
wilt Thou help me.&nbsp; Thy name is Love, and Thy glory is the 
likeness of Thy Son Jesus Christ, who said, &ldquo;Come to me, 
all ye that are weary and <!-- page 189--><a

laden, and I will give you rest;&rdquo; &ldquo;If ye being evil

your heavenly Father give His Holy Spirit to them that ask 
Him.&rdquo;</p>

God&mdash;the very birds, and bees, and flowers are that; and do 
their duty far better than I&mdash;God forgive me&mdash;do 
mine.</p>
<p>I am Thine&mdash;not merely Thy child&mdash;but I am Thy 
school child.&nbsp; O Lord Jesus Christ, I claim Thy help as my 
schoolmaster, as well as my Lord and Saviour.&nbsp; I am the 
least of Thy school children; and it may <!-- page 190--><a 
name="page190"></a><span class="pagenum">p. 190</span>be the most
ignorant and stupid.&nbsp; I do not pretend to be a scholar, a 
divine, a philosopher, a saint.&nbsp; I am a very weak, 
insufficient scholar, sitting on the lowest form in Thy great 
school-house, which is the whole world, and trying to spell out 
the mere letters of Thy alphabet, in hope that hereafter I may be
able to make out whole words and whole sentences of Thy 
commandments, and having learnt them, to do them.&nbsp; If Thou 
wilt but teach me Thy statutes, O Lord, then I will try to keep 
them to the end; for I long to be on Thy side, and about Thy 
work.&nbsp; I long to help, be it ever so little, in making 
myself better, and my neighbour better.&nbsp; I long to be 
useful, and not useless; a fruit-bearing tree, and not a noxious 
weed in Thy garden; and therefore I pray that Thou wilt not <!-- 
page 191--><a name="page191"></a><span class="pagenum">p. 
191</span>cut me down or root me up, nor let foul creatures 
trample me under foot.</p>
<p>Have mercy upon me, O Lord, in my trouble, for the sake of the
truth which I long to learn, and for the good which I long to 
do.&nbsp; Poor weak plant though I may be, I am still a plant of 
Thy planting, which is struggling to grow, and flower, and bear 
fruit to eternal life; and Thou wilt not despise the work of 
Thine own hands, O Lord, who died that I might live? Thou wilt 
not let me perish!&nbsp; I have stuck unto Thy testimonies.&nbsp;
O Lord, confound me not!</p>
<p style="text-align: right">Amen.</p>
<h3>CONFESSION OF ONE IN CONFUSION OF SPIRIT.</h3>
<p>O God, Thou knowest, and Thou alone, how far I am right, and 
how far wrong.&nbsp; <!-- page 192--><a name="page192"></a><span 
class="pagenum">p. 192</span>I leave myself in Thy hand, certain 
that Thou wilt deal fairly, justly, lovingly with me, as a Father
with his son.&nbsp; I do not pretend to be better than I am; 
neither will I pretend to be worse than I am.&nbsp; Truly I know 
nothing about it.&nbsp; I, ignorant human being that I am, can 
never fully know how far I am right, and how far wrong.&nbsp; I 
find light and darkness fighting together in my heart, and I 
cannot divide between them.&nbsp; But Thou, Lord, canst.&nbsp; 
Thou knowest.&nbsp; Thou hast made me; Thou lovest me; Thou hast 
sent Thy Son into the world to make me what I ought to be.&nbsp; 
Thou wiliest not that I should perish, but come to the knowledge 
of the truth; and therefore I believe that I shall not perish, 
but come to the knowledge of the truth about Thee, about my own 
character, my <!-- page 193--><a name="page193"></a><span 
class="pagenum">p. 193</span>own duty, about everything which it 
is needful for me to know.&nbsp; Therefore, O Lord, I will go 
boldly on, doing my duty as well as I can, though not perfectly, 
day by day; and asking Thee day by day to feed my soul with daily
bread.&nbsp; Thou feedest my body with daily bread.&nbsp; How 
much more wilt Thou feed my mind and my heart, more precious by 
far than my body.&nbsp; Lord, I will trust Thee for soul and body
alike; and if I need correcting for my sins, I know this, at 
least, that the worst thing that can happen to me, or to any man,
is to do wrong and not to be corrected; and the best thing is to 
be set right, even by hard blows, as often as I stray out of the 
way.&nbsp; Therefore, O Lord, I will take my punishment quietly 
and manfully, and try to thank Thee for it, <!-- page 194--><a 
name="page194"></a><span class="pagenum">p. 194</span>as I ought;
for I know that Thou wilt not punish me beyond what I deserve, 
but far below what I deserve.&nbsp; I know Thou wilt punish me 
only to bring me to myself, and to correct me, and purge me, and 
strengthen me.&nbsp; I believe, O Lord, on the warrant of Thine 
own word I believe it&mdash;undeserved as the honour is, that 
Thou art my Father, and lovest me; Thou dost not afflict any man 
willingly, or grieve the children of men out of passion or out of
spite.&nbsp; Thou wiliest not that I, or any man, should perish; 
but Thou wiliest have all men to be saved and come to the 
knowledge of the truth, for Jesus Christ His sake.</p>
<p style="text-align: right">Amen.</p>
<h3>CONFESSION OF A TORMENTED SOUL.</h3>
<p>O Lord, I am in misery&mdash;my soul is sore 
troubled&mdash;for I have sinned, and I <!-- page 195--><a 
name="page195"></a><span class="pagenum">p. 195</span>confess 
that I only receive the due reward of my deeds.&nbsp; I have 
earned my shame, I have earned my sorrow; Lord, I have deserved 
it all.&nbsp; I look back on wasted time and wasted powers.&nbsp;
I look round on ruined health, ruined fortune, ruined hopes; I 
confess that I deserve it all.&nbsp; But Thou hast endured more 
than this for me, and Thou hast done nothing amiss.&nbsp; For me 
Thou didst suffer, for me Thou hast been crucified, and me Thou 
hast been trying to save all through the years of my 
vanity.&nbsp; Perhaps I have not wearied out Thy love, perhaps I 
have not conquered Thy patience.&nbsp; I will take the blessed 
chance.&nbsp; I will still cast myself upon Thy love.&nbsp; O 
Lord, I have deserved all my misery.&nbsp; Yet, Lord, remember me
when Thou comest into Thy kingdom.</p>
<p style="text-align: right">Amen.</p>
<p><!-- page 196--><a name="page196"></a><span class="pagenum">p.
196</span>Father! not our will but Thine be done.&nbsp; All 
things come from Thy hand, and therefore all things come from Thy
love.&nbsp; We have received good from Thy hand, and shall we not
receive evil?&nbsp; Though Thou slay us, yet will we trust in 
Thee.&nbsp; For Thou art gracious and merciful, long-suffering 
and of great goodness.&nbsp; Thou art loving to every man, and 
Thy mercy is over all Thy works.&nbsp; Thou art righteous in all 
Thy ways, and holy in all Thy doings.&nbsp; Thou art nigh unto 
them that call upon Thee.&nbsp; Thou wilt hear their cry, and 
wilt help them; for all Thou desirest, when Thou sendest trouble 
on us, is to make us wiser and better.&nbsp; And that Thou canst 
only make us by teaching us the knowledge of Thyself.&nbsp; Glory
be to Thee, O God!</p>

Updated editions will replace the previous one--the old editions
will be renamed.

Creating the works from public domain print editions means that no
one owns a United States copyright in these works, so the Foundation
(and you!) can copy and distribute it in the United States without
permission and without paying copyright royalties.  Special rules,
set forth in the General Terms of Use part of this license, apply to
copying and distributing Project Gutenberg-tm electronic works to
protect the PROJECT GUTENBERG-tm concept and trademark.  Project
Gutenberg is a registered trademark, and may not be used if you
charge for the eBooks, unless you receive specific permission.  If you
do not charge anything for copies of this eBook, complying with the
rules is very easy.  You may use this eBook for nearly any purpose
such as creation of derivative works, reports, performances and
research.  They may be modified and printed and given away--you may do
practically ANYTHING with public domain eBooks.  Redistribution is
subject to the trademark license, especially commercial
redistribution.

1.B.  "Project Gutenberg" is a registered trademark.  It may only be

both the Project Gutenberg Literary Archive Foundation and Michael
Hart, the owner of the Project Gutenberg-tm trademark.  Contact the

1.F.

1.F.1.  Project Gutenberg volunteers and employees expend considerable
effort to identify, do copyright research on, transcribe and proofread
public domain works in creating the Project Gutenberg-tm
collection.  Despite these efforts, Project Gutenberg-tm electronic
works, and the medium on which they may be stored, may contain
"Defects," such as, but not limited to, incomplete, inaccurate or
corrupt data, transcription errors, a copyright or other intellectual
property infringement, a defective or damaged disk or other medium, a
computer virus, or computer codes that damage or cannot be read by
your equipment.

1.F.2.  LIMITED WARRANTY, DISCLAIMER OF DAMAGES - Except for the "Right
of Replacement or Refund" described in paragraph 1.F.3, the Project
Gutenberg Literary Archive Foundation, the owner of the Project
Gutenberg-tm trademark, and any other party distributing a Project
Gutenberg-tm electronic work under this agreement, disclaim all
liability to you for damages, costs and expenses, including legal
fees.  YOU AGREE THAT YOU HAVE NO REMEDIES FOR NEGLIGENCE, STRICT
LIABILITY, BREACH OF WARRANTY OR BREACH OF CONTRACT EXCEPT THOSE
PROVIDED IN PARAGRAPH F3.  YOU AGREE THAT THE FOUNDATION, THE
TRADEMARK OWNER, AND ANY DISTRIBUTOR UNDER THIS AGREEMENT WILL NOT BE
LIABLE TO YOU FOR ACTUAL, DIRECT, INDIRECT, CONSEQUENTIAL, PUNITIVE OR
INCIDENTAL DAMAGES EVEN IF YOU GIVE NOTICE OF THE POSSIBILITY OF SUCH
DAMAGE.

1.F.3.  LIMITED RIGHT OF REPLACEMENT OR REFUND - If you discover a
defect in this electronic work within 90 days of receiving it, you can
receive a refund of the money (if any) you paid for it by sending a
written explanation to the person you received the work from.  If you
received the work on a physical medium, you must return the medium with
your written explanation.  The person or entity that provided you with
the defective work may elect to provide a replacement copy in lieu of a
refund.  If you received the work electronically, the person or entity
providing it to you may choose to give you a second opportunity to
receive the work electronically in lieu of a refund.  If the second copy
is also defective, you may demand a refund in writing without further
opportunities to fix the problem.

1.F.4.  Except for the limited right of replacement or refund set forth
in paragraph 1.F.3, this work is provided to you 'AS-IS', WITH NO OTHER
WARRANTIES OF ANY KIND, EXPRESS OR IMPLIED, INCLUDING BUT NOT LIMITED TO
WARRANTIES OF MERCHANTIBILITY OR FITNESS FOR ANY PURPOSE.

1.F.5.  Some states do not allow disclaimers of certain implied
warranties or the exclusion or limitation of certain types of damages.
If any disclaimer or limitation set forth in this agreement violates the
law of the state applicable to this agreement, the agreement shall be
interpreted to make the maximum disclaimer or limitation permitted by
the applicable state law.  The invalidity or unenforceability of any
provision of this agreement shall not void the remaining provisions.

1.F.6.  INDEMNITY - You agree to indemnify and hold the Foundation, the
trademark owner, any agent or employee of the Foundation, anyone
providing copies of Project Gutenberg-tm electronic works in accordance
with this agreement, and any volunteers associated with the production,
promotion and distribution of Project Gutenberg-tm electronic works,
harmless from all liability, costs and expenses, including legal fees,
that arise directly or indirectly from any of the following which you do
or cause to occur: (a) distribution of this or any Project Gutenberg-tm
work, (b) alteration, modification, or additions or deletions to any
Project Gutenberg-tm work, and (c) any Defect you cause.


Section  2.  Information about the Mission of Project Gutenberg-tm

Project Gutenberg-tm is synonymous with the free distribution of
electronic works in formats readable by the widest variety of computers
including obsolete, old, middle-aged and new computers.  It exists
because of the efforts of hundreds of volunteers and donations from
people in all walks of life.

Volunteers and financial support to provide volunteers with the
assistance they need, is critical to reaching Project Gutenberg-tm's
goals and ensuring that the Project Gutenberg-tm collection will
remain freely available for generations to come.  In 2001, the Project
Gutenberg Literary Archive Foundation was created to provide a secure
and permanent future for Project Gutenberg-tm and future generations.
To learn more about the Project Gutenberg Literary Archive Foundation
and how your efforts and donations can help, see Sections 3 and 4
and the Foundation web page at http://www.gutenberg.org/fundraising/pglaf.

Section 4.  Information about Donations to the Project Gutenberg
Literary Archive Foundation

Project Gutenberg-tm depends upon and cannot survive without wide
spread public support and donations to carry out its mission of
increasing the number of public domain and licensed works that can be
freely distributed in machine readable form accessible by the widest
array of equipment including outdated equipment.  Many small donations
($1 to $5,000) are particularly important to maintaining tax exempt
status with the IRS.

The Foundation is committed to complying with the laws regulating
charities and charitable donations in all 50 states of the United
States.  Compliance requirements are not uniform and it takes a
considerable effort, much paperwork and many fees to meet and keep up
with these requirements.  We do not solicit donations in locations
where we have not received written confirmation of compliance.  To
SEND DONATIONS or determine the status of compliance for any
particular state visit http://www.gutenberg.org/fundraising/donate

While we cannot and do not solicit contributions from states where we
have not met the solicitation requirements, we know of no prohibition
against accepting unsolicited donations from donors in such states who
approach us with offers to donate.

International donations are gratefully accepted, but we cannot make
any statements concerning tax treatment of donations received from
outside the United States.  U.S. laws alone swamp our small staff.

Please check the Project Gutenberg Web pages for current donation
methods and addresses.  Donations are accepted in a number of other
ways including checks, online payments and credit card donations.

Section 5.  General Information About Project Gutenberg-tm electronic
works.

Professor Michael S. Hart is the originator of the Project Gutenberg-tm
concept of a library of electronic works that could be freely shared
with anyone.  For thirty years, he produced and distributed Project
Gutenberg-tm eBooks with only a loose network of volunteer support.

Project Gutenberg-tm eBooks are often created from several printed
editions, all of which are confirmed as Public Domain in the U.S.
unless a copyright notice is included.  Thus, we do not necessarily
keep eBooks in compliance with any particular paper edition.

Most people start at our Web site which has the main PG search facility:

     http://www.gutenberg.org

This Web site includes information about Project Gutenberg-tm,
including how to make donations to the Project Gutenberg Literary
Archive Foundation, how to help produce our new eBooks, and how to
subscribe to our email newsletter to hear about new eBooks.
